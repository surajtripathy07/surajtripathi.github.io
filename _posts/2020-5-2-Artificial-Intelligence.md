This content is for me to comeback to and for others who might want to get a quick primer/overview of the contents in the course. It may also be used as series of post to learn a bit about Artificial Intelligence. Most of the content will be taken from the course book Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach and [Udacity lectures](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud954).
